<h1>Pre-work Phase 1</h1>
<p>Git is version control software that we run on our computer.</p>
<p>GitHub is a remote web application that works with git to help us collaborate and share our code with others.</p>
<p>ddc-web-student.cnm.edu is the bootcamp server that runs our code.</p>
<p>We add and commit our code to Git on our computer.</p>
<p>we PUSH our code from our computer to GitHub.</p>
<p>we DEPLOY our code from our computer to the bootcamp server.</p>
<p>DEPLOY and PUSH are different!</p>
